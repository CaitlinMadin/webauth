		<p>HTML5 has been developed to incorporate the new era of website browsing on a mobile, tablet device as well as a desktop. Whilst HTML4 can still be and is used its more beneficial to aim your development towards HTML5. The advantages of following best practice and standards set by W3C are to “enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device.” (Standard-W3org, 2018). This is a matter of opinion to some people as they find that following the standards set my W3C restrict and limits a developer. This is mostly the opinion of people with limited knowledge to develop a website to a high standard whilst its considered to also limit creativity and design of a website. HTML enables you to include multimedia such as audio and video clips, 2D shapes via canvas, geolocation and other new aspects.</p>

<p>Whilst HTML5 is still implemented to provide a more consistence experience for the developers there is still support and will carry on being support for HTML4. On the other hand, HTML5 new syntax and elements can be over looked but this is mostly due to the fact they are still implementing the code, but they are still adding support for new features as and when they are being released to be used for development. There is a website where you can check to see if the browser is compatible with HTML5: https://html5test.com/ this gives you a score of compatibility to the browser and HTML5.</p>

<p>The requirements of WCAG   - The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are for the developer to aim at developing a website for better user ability for people with disabilities without the aid of adapting the website, by the user to make it disability friendly. There are over  285 million people worldwide who have some form of disability (Sitepointcom, 2014). People with any form of disability whether it to be age-related, sight, or hearing disability should be able to use a website if the developer has followed the standards provided so its perceived and is used competently which realistically involves all parties to the website. The disadvantage’s of making a website user accessible it that It can take longer to develop due to the multiple advance implementation of interaction which can take longer to bring together as well as being aware as a designer where you are placing navigational or buttons and if these are easily accessible to with a disability.</p>

<p>HTML5 now has in built tags for multimedia rather than using plugins from other RIA platforms. Using these tags implies that videos and audios are supported by most modern browsers such as, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and others. You can also style the videos to fit your website design with little effort needed to make it look flawless. </p>

<p>HTML4 had various examples of poor syntax :“closing tags are often optional. As an example - paragraphs in HTML4 are automatically ended when a new paragraph is started. (you don't have to close a paragraph with a tag in HTML4)” (Siliconbeachtrainingcouk, 2011). HTML5 has been introduced to make the development of a website more exclusive when designing a particular part of the website.</p>

	<h3> Interoperability</h3>
		<p>The website which I have developed has been tested, in various web browsers used today such as; Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Edge. This was performed to insure interoperability is possible within each browser. Safari is the only browsers where I came across some responsive issues regarding CSS ‘Anne Marie’ on the main page as well as the ‘Type Writer’ within the news pages. With slight alteration I manged to make the ‘Type Writer’ work but I decided to leave ‘Anne Marie’ is unresponsive due to it slowly the browser down. Within my website I have used web fonts so that across all browsers it can be seen the same (figure 1).</p>

		 <p>I have followed HTML5 mark-up to create a dynamic and effective website among majority of browsers. To do this I have implemented tags such as ‘header’ ‘nav’, ‘footer’, ‘section’. I have also used the new input tag and for HTML graphics I drew varies images on to a canvas whilst using various other tags. I incorporated these tags to follow W3C web standards and specification which will assist towards function ability if there were to be anymore HTML improvements.</p>

		   <img src="assests/ScreenShotsForLog/figure4.jpg" alt="figure4" style="width:50%"> <p>Figure 4</p>
		    
		 
		 <p>Throughout the website I have used varies media queries to check that its compatible with all devices (figure 5). By using media queries, it means that it can enhance the user’s interpretation of the website with its specially tailored design supported by that device. Media queries are used within  CSS style sheet to inform the code directly, what the requirements are for the device being used.</p>

		 <p>I have made sure that majority of CSS works within a variety of browsers but to re-confirm this I have also added browser support prefix’s as you can see if figure 6.</p>

		 <p>I have used JavaScript within my website for my customers to subscribe and sign up on the ‘Sign Up’ page. I have also used JavaScript for slideshows and typography on certain aspects of the website. JavaScript can be inserted into almost any websites regardless of the file extension due to its high interoperability with other languages.  JavaScript whilst used by many developers and accessed within most browsers, can be interpreted differently. I have had no obstruction’s within browsers when loading my website due to my mark-up of certain aspects following the W3C guidelines. JavaScript whilst can work well and can be easily learnt by any one, it can have a drawback to those who are security conscious, whilst rare the security aspects of the code as its loaded on the client’s server can be maliciously exploited (Freecodecamporg, 2018). My customisation of an album was also going to be my local storage but after researching and trying to learn data transfer I realised that I would need some guidance within this area. I will be completing this soon but not for the submission deadline.</p>
